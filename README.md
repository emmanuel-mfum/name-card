# name-card
HTML template for a name card customized by me.

The template I used can be found here: https://github.com/html5up/identity
Background images like the one I used can be found here: https://unsplash.com/

Thanks to some basic understanding of HTML, CSS and how Python servers run on Flask, we are able to serve a nice name card web page.
